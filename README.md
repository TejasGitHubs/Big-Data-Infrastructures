# Cloud Native Analytical Pipeline
Project:
A cloud native analytical pipeline is a data processing and analysis system that is designed to run in a cloud computing environment, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS). The goal of a cloud native analytical pipeline is to enable organizations to quickly and efficiently analyze large volumes of data from various sources to gain insights and make data-driven decisions.

One possible business use for a cloud native analytical pipeline in AWS services is to process and analyze customer data in real-time to support customer relationship management (CRM) efforts. For example, an e-commerce company could use the pipeline to analyze customer purchase history, browsing behavior, and other data to personalize recommendations and offers, improve the customer experience, and increase loyalty and retention.

To pitch the value of a cloud native analytical pipeline to potential stakeholders, you could highlight the following benefits:

Scalability: The pipeline can handle large volumes of data and scale up or down as needed to meet changing demand, without the need for upfront infrastructure investments.

Flexibility: The pipeline can process and analyze data from various sources, such as databases, streaming data, and flat files, and can be easily modified to meet changing business needs.

Cost-efficiency: The pipeline can take advantage of pay-as-you-go pricing models and other cost-saving features of cloud computing, such as automatic scaling and resource allocation, to reduce operational costs.

Speed: The pipeline can process and analyze data in real-time or near-real-time, enabling organizations to make timely and informed decisions.

Security: The pipeline can be configured to meet the security and
